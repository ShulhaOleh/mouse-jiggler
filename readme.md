# Mouse Jiggler

</div>

Simple C++ tool that moves your cursor a few pixels over a certain period of time.

## Purpose

If you need to prevent a utility (a program that tracks your mouse movements) from detecting that you are inactive, this small utility will help you do that.

## Known issues

* In the Linux version, the cursor sticks to the upper left corner of the monitor screen.
